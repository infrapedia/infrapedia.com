THE PARTIES AGREE THAT A PARTY MAY BRING\r\n        CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN EACH'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS\r\n        A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR\r\n        REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY\r\n        GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER.
